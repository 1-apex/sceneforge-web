# SceneForge — Design 3D Scenes for React

SceneForge is an early-stage, open-source design tool that helps React developers create simple 3D scenes visually and export clean, editable React Three Fiber JSX.

This repository contains the **landing website** for SceneForge — an introduction to the idea, workflow, and philosophy behind the project.

## What is SceneForge?

If you’ve ever tried adding a bit of 3D to a React app, you’ve probably felt the friction:

- Blender is powerful, but often overkill for basic web scenes
- Writing positions, rotations, and scales by hand is tedious
- Translating design intent into JSX is slow

SceneForge exists to reduce that friction.

It is **not** a 3D engine.
It is **not** a full modeling tool.

It’s a small, focused helper that fits naturally into a modern React + Three.js workflow.

## What this site shows

- A live 3D preview rendered with React Three Fiber
- Example JSX output generated from a visual scene
- The core value proposition of SceneForge

This site does **not** contain the full editor itself.

## The Editor

The SceneForge editor allows you to:

- Place basic 3D primitives visually
- Adjust transforms (position, rotation, scale)
- Export readable, deterministic JSX
- Paste the output directly into your React app

You can access the editor here:

## Status

SceneForge is an **early prototype** under active development.

APIs, UI, and exported output may change as the project evolves.
